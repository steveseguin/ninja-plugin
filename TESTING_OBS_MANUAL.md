# OBS Manual Test Matrix

Use this checklist on a real OBS install to validate plugin behavior beyond browser-only automation.

## Preconditions

- OBS restarted after plugin install
- `Settings -> Stream` shows `VDO.Ninja` service
- `Add Source` shows `VDO.Ninja Source`

## Test 1: Direct View, Password

1. Set stream settings:
   - Stream ID: `manual-pass-01`
   - Password: `somepassword`
   - Room ID: empty
2. Start streaming from OBS.
3. Open viewer URL:
   - `https://vdo.ninja/?view=manual-pass-01&password=somepassword`

Pass criteria:
- Video and audio play
- Reloading viewer reconnects quickly
- OBS stream remains stable

## Test 2: Direct View, No Password

1. Stream ID: `manual-open-01`
2. Password: empty
3. Start streaming
4. Open:
   - `https://vdo.ninja/?view=manual-open-01`

Pass criteria:
- Video/audio play
- Reload survives without session break

## Test 3: Room + Password

1. Stream ID: `manual-room-01`
2. Room ID: `manual-room-a`
3. Password: `somepassword`
4. Start streaming
5. Open:
   - `https://vdo.ninja/?view=manual-room-01&room=manual-room-a&scene&password=somepassword`

Pass criteria:
- Viewer joins and receives media
- Scene/room refresh reconnects correctly

## Test 4: Multi-Viewer Stability

1. Keep one stream active from tests above.
2. Open 2-3 viewer tabs/devices on same view URL.
3. Let run for 10+ minutes.

Pass criteria:
- All viewers continue playing
- No repeated reconnect loops
- OBS CPU/network remains acceptable

## Test 5: High Bitrate + Audio Quality

1. Set higher OBS output bitrate (for example 10-15 Mbps).
2. Publish to VDO.Ninja with active audio content.
3. Monitor stats and subjective quality in viewer(s).

Pass criteria:
- Audio remains continuous (no frequent dropouts)
- Video remains smooth enough for target FPS
- Refresh reconnect still works

## Test 6: Firefox Viewer

1. Run any active stream from tests 1-3.
2. Open view URL in Firefox.

Pass criteria:
- Audio/video present
- Refresh reconnects

## Capture for Regression Tracking

- OBS log file
- VDO.Ninja stats snapshot (codec, bitrate, packet loss, RTT)
- Stream URL pattern used (room/password/no-password)
- Approximate test duration and failure timestamp
