  - Expanded `INSTALL.md` with install, update, uninstall, and portable-path guidance
- `TESTING_OBS_MANUAL.md` for real OBS validation matrix
- `SECURITY_AND_TRUST.md` for checksum/signing guidance
- Optional nightly live internet e2e workflow: `.github/workflows/live-e2e.yml`

### Changed
- README and GitHub Pages content clarified around install UX, trust model, and known limitations

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Package-level installation guide (`INSTALL.md`) included in release archives
- Package installer helpers included in release artifacts:
  - Windows: `install.ps1`
  - Linux/macOS: `install.sh`
- Additional locale files for common OBS user languages:
  - `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR`, `it-IT`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `nl-NL`, `pl-PL`, `pt-BR`, `ru-RU`, `tr-TR`, `zh-CN`
- Firefox receive/playback verification script for Chromium publisher -> Firefox viewer:
  - `scripts/playwright-vdo-firefox-view-check.cjs`

### Changed
- Release packaging workflow now bundles `INSTALL.md` and platform install helper scripts
- E2E scenario builder now supports room/no-password/bitrate matrices with room-safe view semantics (`room + scene + view`)
- README and GitHub Pages content rewritten for clearer product purpose, value proposition, and usage guidance
- Version bumped to `1.1.2`

### Tested
- E2E matrix:
  - Default password/no-room: `npm test` (3 passed)
  - Room + password + high bitrate: reload and multi-view specs passed
  - No-password mode: `npm test` with `VDO_NO_PASSWORD=1` (3 passed)
  - Firefox viewer checks passed (room/password/high bitrate and no-password scenarios)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Data-channel WHEP URL extraction for nested payload variants (`whepSettings`, `whepScreenSettings`, `info`)
- Initial VDO.Ninja-style `msg.info` data-channel message from publisher to viewers
- Multi-viewer Playwright e2e spec validating one publisher feeding multiple viewers with active media
- Licensing and release compliance docs:
  - `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
  - `RELEASE_COMPLIANCE.md`

### Changed
- Viewer limit enforcement now counts pending publisher peers (`New`/`Connecting`/`Connected`), preventing burst over-admission
- Release packaging workflow now includes `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, and `RELEASE_COMPLIANCE.md` in artifacts
- Metadata/license consistency updates to `AGPL-3.0-only` across build and package files
- Version bumped to `1.1.1`

### Tested
- Unit tests: `ctest --test-dir build-verify --output-on-failure` (290 passed, 0 failed)
- Plugin build: `cmake --build build-plugin -j 8` (Windows DLL built successfully)
- E2E (Playwright):
  - `vdoninja-publish-view-reload.spec.js` passed (playback survives reload with active media)
  - `vdoninja-multi-viewers.spec.js` passed (two simultaneous viewers with active tracks/bytes)
  - Combined run: `2 passed`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Normalized VDO.Ninja signaling parser for `description`, legacy SDP, offer requests, candidate bundles, listings, and WHEP URL hints
- Auto-inbound scene management to create/update/remove OBS Browser Sources from room events and data channel hints
- Deterministic grid layout helper for auto-managed inbound scenes
- New unit tests for signaling protocol parsing and layout generation

### Changed
- Signaling client now supports explicit offer request handling (`offerSDP` / `sendOffer`) and richer offer/answer envelopes
- Peer manager now responds to offer requests and supports RTP packetizer paths (H264/Opus) with RTCP helpers
- Output lifecycle and encoder/capture start checks improved for safer start/stop behavior
- Build now allows OpenSSL to be optional and includes an internal SHA-256 implementation for testability

### Tested

- Plugin build: `cmake --build build-plugin --config RelWithDebInfo --target obs-vdoninja`
- Endpoint reachability checks:
  - `https://vdo.ninja/?view=CoatdevdavER`
