- Plugin support URL metadata updated to the new repository issues URL
- Windows installer output now omits stale quickstart path text when `QUICKSTART.md` is not present
- Version bumped to `1.1.3`

### Tested
- Local package simulation on Windows:
  - `install.cmd` successfully installed plugin/data into a test OBS root
  - `uninstall.cmd -RemoveData` successfully removed plugin/data

- Version bumped to `1.1.2`

### Tested
- E2E matrix:
  - Default password/no-room: `npm test` (3 passed)
